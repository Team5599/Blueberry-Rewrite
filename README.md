# Blueberry-Rewrite

Updated, command-based code for 2022's robot for FIRST RAPID REACT, Blueberry!

This is the updated version of [Blueberry's](https://github.com/Team5599/Robot2022) code, written in the command-based paradigm and retroactively applicable to the components on the robot.

- Due to drivetrain and shooter mechanical changes, Blueberry's motor controllers have all been replaced with brushed-motor SPARK controllers, with only one SPARK MAX remaining for the only brushless motor on the robot, which now uses the PWM interface to communicate with the roboRIO rather than CAN. These physical changes have been reflected in the robot code.
